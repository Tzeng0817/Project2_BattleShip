Used the Python [Arcade](http://arcade.academy) (MIT License so open for basically whatever) Library
for graphical interaction. Specifically used the following example projects to base our views
- [Array Backed Grid Buffered](http://arcade.academy/examples/array_backed_grid_buffered.html#array-backed-grid-buffered)
- [Using Views for Instruction and Game Over Screens](http://arcade.academy/examples/view_instructions_and_game_over.html?highlight=game%20over%20screens)
- [Text Buttons](http://arcade.academy/examples/gui_text_button.html?highlight=text%20buttons)

Sound effects came from the macOS Text to Speech Tool (Open for non-commercial uses).

Used Team KRAAG's BattleShip project, updated with several features:
- Three different level modes of AI: easy/ medium/ hard
- ScoreBoard
- Special Shots
